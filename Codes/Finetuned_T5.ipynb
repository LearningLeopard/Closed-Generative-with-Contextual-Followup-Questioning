Involuntary abandonment of LPR status is more common than voluntary abandonment. If you live abroad for longer than one year and no longer have ties to the United States, you may face involuntary green card abandonment. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at a United States port of entry usually determines if you abandoned your status. The officer can also take your card and let an immigration judge decide your status. If you planned to return to the United States earlier but were kept away due to an unexpected issue, you could try to convince the border officer or immigration judge you did not intend to abandon your U.S. residence. However, if you plan to spend more than one year outside the United States, you should apply for are-entry permitorSB-1 visa, also known as a returning resident visa, before you leave.'}\n",

Without a green card, you usually need to file a visa application to travel to the United States. If you are a citizen of certain countries, you can travel without a visa under theVisa Waiver Program. If you travel to the United States without an updated visa, you could face removal proceedings or deportation. If you voluntarily gave up your green card, you must carry the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) response to your submitted Form I-407 when re-entering the United States. In the future, you can apply for a new green card. But you will have to restart the process completely. Keep in mind that your eligibility may have changed. For example, if you applied for a green card as a minor child of a U.S. citizen but you are no longer a minor and are married to a noncitizen, you no longer qualify.'}\n",

To check how much of your assets you’ll have to include on your Affidavit of Support to substitute for your income, be sure to do the following: Using the above tables, locate yourminimum income requirementdepending on your household size and civilian versus military status.Find the difference between your minimum income requirement and your actual combined household income.If you (the sponsor) are a U.S. citizen, multiply this difference by three. If you (the sponsor) are a green card holder, multiply this difference by five. The result of this calculation will give you the total asset value you’ll need to satisfy the minimum income requirement. Once you’ve found your needed asset value, you can begin figuring out which assets to count to meet the requirement. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the government agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that will process your application. USCIS only allows you to count assets that could be converted into cash within just one year, without any considerable financial loss to the asset owner.'}\n",
      "{'category': 'Green Cards', 'question': 'Examples of Included Assets', 'answer': 'In most cases, the sponsor’s income you may include will be the same as the amount you reported on your most recent U.S. federal income tax return. You can find this figure on line nine of Internal Revenue Service (IRS)Form 1040. Your total income includes your wages, salaries, retirement benefits, alimony, child support, dividends or earned interest, and any legally obtained income from other sources. If your income is not enough to satisfy the minimum income requirement for sponsorship, you may include your other adult household members’ income. But you will only be able to include this additional income if they commit to making this income available to help provide financial support to your green card applicant relative. If you want to have other household members’ incomes counted, they will need to completeForm I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member. If you still fail to meet the minimum income requirement even with other household members’ added income, you may obtain a co-sponsor, orjoint sponsor. A joint sponsor is someone who does not live in your household but who will accept full financial responsibility for your green card applicant relative. A co-sponsor will need to complete their own Form I-864. They will also need to meet the minimum income requirement on their own. A co-sponsor does not need to be a family member, but they need to be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident who lives in the United States. You may also include income from the green card applicant themself, but only if they will continue to receive their income from the same source after receiving their green card. If you currently don’t live in the United States, your foreign income will not count toward your minimum income requirement. But if you prove that you will stay in your current job once you enter the United States or get a new position in the United States that meets the financial requirements, you may count your foreign income. For example, if you are transferring from your company’s foreign office to their U.S.-based office, you would qualify. If you were initially working remotely, you would also be eligible to count foreign income. If you find that your total household income does not yet satisfy the minimum income requirement, you may count your assets to make up the difference. In addition to your assets, you may count other household members’ assets if both of the following are true: You are related to them by birth, marriage, or adoption.You have either lived with them for the past six months or have listed them as dependents on your most recent tax return. To check how much of your assets you’ll have to include on your Affidavit of Support to substitute for your income, be sure to do the following: Using the above tables, locate yourminimum income requirementdepending on your household size and civilian versus military status.Find the difference between your minimum income requirement and your actual combined household income.If you (the sponsor) are a U.S. citizen, multiply this difference by three. If you (the sponsor) are a green card holder, multiply this difference by five. The result of this calculation will give you the total asset value you’ll need to satisfy the minimum income requirement. Once you’ve found your needed asset value, you can begin figuring out which assets to count to meet the requirement. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the government agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that will process your application. USCIS only allows you to count assets that could be converted into cash within just one year, without any considerable financial loss to the asset owner. Your included assets may be savings accounts, stocks and bonds, mutual fund investments, and certificates of deposit (CDs). You are also able to use your home’s net value as an asset. Your home’s net value includes any mortgages or unpaid fees on the home subtracted from the home’s appraised value. You will also be able to include the net value of a car. However, you will only be able to do so if you own another vehicle you haven’t yet counted as an asset. The net value of your car will be the market value of your car minus any outstanding auto loans on your vehicle. You may also count assets belonging to your green card applicant spouse (or the intending immigrant). You may count their assets regardless of where they live and even if they hold non-U.S. or foreign assets. To apply foreign holdings to the minimum income requirement, the green card applicant must meet the following guidelines: They have liquid assets, which they may convert into cash within one year.They can move their assets from their current country of residence to the United States.The total value of their assets must be at least five times the difference between your (the sponsor’s) income and your minimum income requirement.

      "{'category': 'Green Cards', 'question': 'What Is the Green Card Number?', 'answer': 'Your green card number is a 13-digit number that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) assigns to your specificgreen cardapplication. Your green card number is printed on your permanent resident card. The green card number is sometimes called a “case number,” “permanent resident card number,” or an “I-551 receipt number.” Form I-551 is the form number for a green card. Your green card number isnotthe same thing as youralien registration number(A-number), which is also printed on your green card. Your green card number is also not the same thing as your USCIS number, which can be found on the front of your card.'}\n",
      "{'category': 'Green Cards', 'question': 'Where Is the Green Card Number on Your Card?', 'answer': 'If you have the current version of the green card, you’ll find your green card number printed on the card’s backside at the bottom. Your green card number is in the first line of a long string of 90 characters, made of letters, numbers, and less-than symbols (<<). Your green card number begins with three letters and ends with 10 numbers. For example:  Sample Green Card - Back  Sample Green Card - Front If you have an older version of the green card, your number may be at the bottom of the front of your card. For example:\\u200d  Sample Green Card - Old Version On much older green card versions, there is no green card number on the card. If your card has no green card number, it means that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) was not using the green card number at the time they issued your card.'}\n",
      "{'category': 'Green Cards', 'question': 'Understanding the Green Card Number Format', 'answer': 'As we mentioned, your green card number is found in the first line of a string of 90 characters on your card. That line begins with either a “C1” or “C2,” which indicates whether you are a permanent resident living in the United States (C1), or a permanent resident commuter (C2). The letters “USA” follow, indicating your country of permanent residence. The next ten numbers in the sequence are youralien number. Finally, your green card number comes next. The first three letters of your green card number represent the service center that processed your card. Each USCIS service center has a three-letter code: CSC - California Service CenterEAC - Eastern Adjudication Center (which is now the Vermont Service Center)IOE - ELIS e-file (for applications filed online)LIN - Lincoln Service Center (which is now the Nebraska Service Center)MSC -\\xa0 Missouri Service Center (which is now the National Benefits Center)NSC - Nebraska Service CenterNBC - National Benefits CenterSRC - Southern Regional Center (which is now the Texas Service Center)TSC - Texas Service CenterVSC - Vermont Service CenterWAC - Western Adjudication Center (which is now the California Service Center)YSC - Potomac Service Center For example, if your green card number readsEAC 20 005 40421, you know that your green card was processed in the Eastern Adjudication Center (EAC), which is now the Vermont Service Center. After the service center code, the next two numbers represent the fiscal year when you submitted your green card application to the U.S. government. The U.S. government’s fiscal year begins on October 1st and ends on September 30th of the following year, so this date will not necessarily match your calendar date. In our sample green card number,EAC 20 005 40421,the fiscal year is represented by 20, meaning that the government received that green card case in October 2019. The next part of the green card number represents what’s called the “computer workday.” A computer workday is a three-digit number based on the regular 365-day calendar, which excludes weekends and holidays. So, in our sample green card number,EAC 20 005 40421, the government agency received the green card application on the fifth workday of fiscal year 2020. The final part of the green card number is the 5-digit case number. In our example, the green card holder’s case number is40421. Your case number is unique to you and represents the number USCIS assigned to the green card application that they ultimately approved.'}\n"
